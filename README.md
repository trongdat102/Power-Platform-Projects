Description:
Designed and implemented a workload planning system to manage and distribute employee hours across multiple shipbuilding or engineering projects. The system integrates Power Apps for data entry, Power Automate for syncing with SharePoint, and Power BI for visualizing workloads against a 40-hour weekly cap per employee.
Key features include dynamic form logic, project-week-hour breakdown, and Power Query transformations for optimized reporting.

2. Visitor Registration App – Corporate Office (Personal Project)
Tools: Power Apps, SharePoint

Developed a calendar-based registration system for managing office visitors. Users can register visitors, view visit schedules on a calendar UI, and edit details via a responsive Power Apps form connected to a SharePoint List. The app supports toggle-based logic for "Issued" and "Returned" actions and restricts manual input based on conditional status.

3. KPI Hours Tracking Dashboard (Personal Project)

Duration: Feb 2025 – Present

Description:
Built an interactive KPI dashboard using Power BI to monitor actual working hours versus KPI targets. The solution includes custom DAX measures to calculate KPIs based on unit types (e.g., h/vessel or engineering formula-driven KPIs). The report includes filters by project, team, and time period, with row-level security and clean visual formatting for stakeholder use.

4. Automation Workflows (Personal Project)
Tools: Power Automate
Duration: Feb 2025 – Present
